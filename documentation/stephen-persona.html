<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h3>
<p>Alex is kind, humble, driven, and resilient. Alex always knew her dream job would include helping others in desperate
    situations and loves that her job allows her to work with people others may cast aside as unworthy or insignificant.
    She is naturally a very patient person, always listens before she speaks, but can become inpatient, especially with
    technology which prohibits her from doing her job. She knows what she likes and is very skeptical of changes in
    format; forming new habits can take time and detracts from work.</p>
<h3>Frustrations and Needs:</h3>
<p>Alex desires everything in her life to serve a purpose. She is a fiercely driven person whose tasks are oriented towards
    completing set objectives. Alex is patient but has an executive mindset which seeks to rectify issues in a timely
    manner and in such a way as not to recur. She relies heavily on past knowledge and is happiest when things follow a
    certain, familiar pattern. SHe needs work and personal information to be easily accessible and properly ordered so
    as not to waste time or energy which could be spent on helping others.</p>
<h3>Goals:</h3>
<p>Alex has a variety of goals which all fall under the category of efficiency. She wants to get the most done to serve
    the most amount of people to the best of her and her organization's abilities. No matter what Alex is doing, she
    wants equipment and information to be accessible with a pragmatic design which aids productivity. For Alex, when
    things serve their purpose well one barely notices them at all.</p>
<h3>User Story:</h3>
<p>Alexandra Montgomery: As a casual user, I want to raise awareness about the pothole I hit this morning to save other
    people from damaging their cars.</p>

<h1>Use Case:</h1>

<h3>Pre-Condition: Alex is signed in on the "Pothole-tracker" (working title) homepage on her computer and is ready to
    place a pothole
    on the map.</h3>

<h3>Post Condition: Alex has successfully placed a pin on the map and is ready to input the necessary information.</h3>

<h1>Interaction Flow:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Alex clicks and holds on the map in order to drag it to show the correct location of the pothole she wants to
        log.
    </li>
    <li>The cursor changes to an arrow cross showing she is now moving the position of the map relative to the viewport
        window so long as the mouse clicker remains depressed.
    </li>
    <li>Alex drags the cursor across the page.</li>
    <li>The map responds by remaining fixed to the position of the cursor, revealing new map content in the viewport
        window where the map has been shifted.
    </li>
    <li>Alex eventually finds the area she is looking for, but the are appears small and does not allow her to
        accurately place her pin where she encountered the pothole; She begins to scroll up with her mouse in the hopes
        that it will zoom in on the map, thus showing more detail.
    </li>
    <li>The map responds by zooming in to show more detail.</li>
    <li>Alex once again clicks on the page to drag the map into position.</li>
    <li>Her cursor is transformed into an arrow cross while the mouse clicker remains depressed</li>
    <li>Alex drags the cursor across the page.</li>
    <li>The map responds by remaining fixed to the position of the cursor, revealing new map content in the viewport
        window where the map has been moved.
    </li>
    <li>Alex sees where she wants to drop a pin to report a pothole and tries clicking on that spot.</li>
    <li>Pothole-Tracker (working title) responds by opening a new window within the map window which presents her a
        variety of options to choose from to report her pothole (such as three options to click on to identify the
        severity of the pothole, only one of which can be selected, and an option to upload a photo(s) of the pothole).
